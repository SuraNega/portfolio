<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Suraphel Nega, and I am 20 years old, residing in Ethiopia. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering while working as a coding teacher at STEAM Power,

   occasionally reading, and I enjoy watching football matches featuring major clubs.</p>
